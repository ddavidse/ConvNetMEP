
-------- CONDA CUDA ENVIRONMENT ----------------------

[open anaconda prompt]

conda create --name pytorch_cuda
activate pytorch_cuda

conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch

[run script with print(torch.cuda.is_available()), verify that it returns true]

conda install -c anaconda spyder
conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib
conda install -c anaconda scipy
conda install scikit-learn

conda update --all

[latest versions of 2 packages contain bugs, reverting to working versions:]

conda install jupyter_client=5.3.1
conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib=3.1.0

[pytorch not working, throwing assertion error, maybe update broke it, trying reinstall]

conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch

pip install loss-landscapes

conda install pandas
conda install seaborn

----------------------------------
note 28-2-2020:

new install in new environment on TU PC did not work, jupyter client 5.3.4 made ipython kernel crash on spyder startup, but attempting to revert to 5.3.1 as before gave a list of incompatibilities

however, doing the same thing on my home PC worked fine, no updates or older versions needed, just a single clean install and everything works

----------------------------------------
note 2-3-2020:

made environment on lab PC, everything is there except libmr
visual studio only has build tools
libmr fails to build wheel
via "pip install [package] --upgrade" I upgraded pip, setuptools and wheel
it did not matter
