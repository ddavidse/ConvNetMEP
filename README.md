# ConvNet
convolutional neural network code 

To use the code:

1. download CNN_functions.py and CNN_masterscript.py and put them in the same folder
2. On lines 46 and 49 (and optionally also 52) enter the correct paths
3. Use lines 56-98 to set the desired parameters and features
4. Run the script

For a basic test, make confusion_flag = True and batchnorm_flag = True while leaving the rest as False
